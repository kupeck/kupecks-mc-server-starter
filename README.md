# kupeck's custom minecraft start.bat

This is my special start.bat file to start your minecraft server, it can be used with any software like Spigot, Paper and Vanilla (and maybe Bukkit? idk).

I am new to programming so i started with something that seemed easy, you can help me if you want!

Since i can speak czech and english i am developing the app and than translating it over, both versions are avalible in the same releases.

I am trying to learn by making this project, but that doesn't mean i won't put effort into making it good to use.
