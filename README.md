# kupeck's custom minecraft start.bat
This is my special start.bat file to star you minecraft server, it can be used with any software like Spigot, Paper and Vanilla (and maybe Bukkit? idk)
I am new to programming so i started with something that seemed easy, you can help me if you want!
Since i can speak czech and english i am developing the app and than translating it over, both versions are avalible in the same releases
